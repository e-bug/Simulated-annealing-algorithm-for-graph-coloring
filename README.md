The goal of the project was to code and experiment the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for the problem of graph coloring.<br />
By reformulating this problem as an optimization one, our task was to construct a Markov chain that sampled correctly from a Boltzmann probability distribution having as state energy a Hamiltonian assigning a unit cost to every edge with two identical colors.
